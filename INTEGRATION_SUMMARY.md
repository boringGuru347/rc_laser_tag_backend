# Frontend-Backend Integration Summary

## Changes Made to Frontend

### 1. **Removed Socket.IO Dependency**
   - Removed `socket.io-client` from `package.json`
   - Removed Socket.IO import from `App.jsx`
   - Backend uses REST API only (no Socket.IO server)

### 2. **Changed API Connection**
   - **Old**: `http://localhost:5000` with Socket.IO
   - **New**: `http://localhost:3000` with REST API
   - Added `API_BASE_URL` constant

### 3. **Implemented REST API Polling**
   - Replaced Socket.IO real-time updates with polling
   - Polls `/retrieve` endpoint every 2 seconds
   - Fetches current game data and updates UI

### 4. **Data Transformation**
   - Backend returns: `{game_no, team_one: [...], team_two: [...], play_time}`
   - Frontend transforms to: `{name, rfid, kills, deaths}`
   - Handles missing player data gracefully

### 5. **Added Features**
   - Connection status indicator (green/red dot)
   - Manual reset function via `/reset` endpoint
   - Game number tracking to detect new games
   - Error handling for network issues

### 6. **Removed Features**
   - Real-time Socket.IO events
   - `checkForOvertake()` function (was empty)
   - Death event animations (can be re-added if backend supports it)

## Backend API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/retrieve` | GET | Get and delete first game in queue |
| `/reset` | POST | Clear current teams being formed |
| `/teams` | GET | Get all registered games (not currently used) |
| `/register` | POST | Register players (used by NFC system) |

## How It Works Now

### Registration Flow:
1. Players scan NFC cards
2. Backend `/register` endpoint adds them to teams
3. When 6 players registered (3 per team), game is created in DB
4. Game added to queue in `registered` collection

### Display Flow:
1. Frontend polls `/retrieve` every 2 seconds
2. Backend returns first game and deletes it from queue
3. Frontend displays teams with kills/deaths
4. UI updates automatically as new data arrives

## Team Structure
- **Team Size**: 3 players per team (6 total per game)
- **Team Names**: "TEAM HEARTS ♥️" and "TEAM SPADES ♠️"
- **Player Stats**: Name, RFID, Kills, Deaths, K/D Ratio

## Current Limitations

1. **No Real-Time Updates During Game**
   - Stats (kills/deaths) are static after game creation
   - Backend doesn't have endpoints to update player stats mid-game
   - Would need to add `/update-stats` endpoint for live gameplay

2. **Game Queue System**
   - `/retrieve` deletes game after fetching
   - No way to keep game displayed while updating stats
   - Consider using `/teams` for non-destructive reads

3. **No Match End Detection**
   - Victory screen logic exists but no trigger from backend
   - Manual match end would require new endpoint

## Recommendations for Future Enhancement

### If you want live gameplay updates:
1. Add Socket.IO to backend
2. Add `/update-stats` endpoint
3. Add `/end-match` endpoint
4. Restore Socket.IO in frontend

### If staying with REST API:
1. Add `/current-game` endpoint (non-destructive read)
2. Add `/update-stats/:gameNo` endpoint
3. Use `/retrieve` only when game actually ends
4. Poll `/current-game` for live updates

## Testing Instructions

### Start Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Start Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### Test Flow:
1. Open frontend in browser
2. Should see "Waiting for players..." message
3. Register 6 players via NFC or API
4. Frontend will fetch and display the game
5. Teams will appear with player names

## Files Modified

### Frontend:
- `src/App.jsx` - Complete rewrite for REST API
- `package.json` - Removed socket.io-client

### Backend:
- No changes made (as requested)

## Notes

- Frontend now compatible with backend REST API (port 3000)
- All UI animations and styling preserved
- Connection status indicator added
- Graceful error handling implemented
- Ready for production testing
